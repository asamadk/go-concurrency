# Go Concurrency ðŸ§µ

A collection of Go programs exploring and implementing core concurrency concepts including goroutines, channels, pipelines, fan-in/fan-out, generators, and more.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository is my hands-on journey to mastering concurrency in Go. Each folder or file demonstrates a specific concept or pattern with explanations and examples.

> ðŸ”§ Language: [Go (Golang)](https://golang.org)
> ðŸ“š Goal: Learn and apply concurrency patterns
> ðŸ§  Outcome: Build a strong foundation for writing efficient, concurrent Go applications

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

Make sure you have Go installed (v1.18+ recommended).

```bash
go run <filename>.go
```
